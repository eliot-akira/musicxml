default-x	tenths	No	Changes the computation of the default horizontal position. The origin is changed relative to the start of the entire current measure, at either the left barline or the start of the system. Positive x is right and negative x is left.

This attribute provides higher-resolution positioning data than the <offset> element. Applications reading a MusicXML file that can understand both features should generally rely on this attribute for its greater accuracy.
